This is a basic implement for stable-diffusion-webui plugin.

# How to use
1. On stable-diffusion-webui side, edit webui-user.bat and  
`set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--nowebui --cors-allow-origins=http://localhost:3000`  
Then start your webui.
2. Once you see **INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:7861**, means you started webui on api mode successfully.
you can open http://127.0.0.1:7861/docs to double check.
3. On StableStudio side, run `yarn dev:use-webui-plugin`
4. once the server started, click settings to check this plugin loaded successfully or not. ![webui-plugin](docs/images/webui-plugin.png)

6. if you need to load existing from webui, you also need to install the extension [sd-webui-StableStudio](https://github.com/jtydhr88/sd-webui-StableStudio))
